# CNMB: Creative NFT Marketplace Builder

![image info](./img/workflow.png)

CNMB is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create their own characters, which are graded by AI and minted as NFTs. These characters have the potential to integrate with gaming in the future, while also being appreciated as unique works of art today. Weâ€™ve selected Gemini as the grading model and use our native token for bidding and trading these NFTs. By leveraging Chainlink, we connect on-chain and off-chain data to ensure seamless functionality. We believe this innovative platform has the potential to make a significant impact in today's digital landscape.
